Follow these steps to delete inactive players based on your criteria (e.g., inactivity, level, or number of pals):

7. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.

## Steps to Restore Your Map(Fog and icons)

### 1. Find the Old Server/World ID

- **Join your old server/world**.
- Open File Explorer and run the search for:  
  `%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\`
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **old server/world ID** (e.g., `FCC47F5F4DD6AC48D3C0E2B30059973D`). The folder with the most recent modification date is typically the one for your **old server/world**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **copy** the `LocalData.sav` file from it.

### 2. Find the New Server/World ID

- **Join your new server/world**.
- Go back to the same folder path:  
  `%localappdata%\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\`
- Look for a folder with a **random ID** (this should be your **Steam ID**).
- Open that folder and **sort the subfolders by the "Last Modified" date**.
- Look for the folder that matches your **new server/world ID**.
- Once you've found the correct folder, **paste** the `LocalData.sav` file from the old server/world ID into this folder.
- If the `LocalData.sav` file already exists in the new folder, **confirm the overwrite** when prompted to replace the existing file.

### 3. Restore Your Map

- Now, go into your **new server/world**, and your map should be restored with the old server/world data.

Done! Your map is back in your **new server/world**!

## Where to find the save files

The save files are usually located at `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\YOURSTEAMID\RANDOMID` for co-op saves.
For server saves, go to the dedicated server's file location through steam.
You need at least 4 files to complete the transfer:

```
- The source player character save in Players folder
- The source world's Level.sav
- The target player character save in Players folder
- The target world's Level.sav
```

## How to use Transfer Character

‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è: Make sure to disable the private locks on the "source" chests before transferring saves!!!

Let's say we want to transfer the character from a coop world of a friend to our own world.
The friend's world would be the source, our own world the destination.

SaveGames folder of our friend:

```
SaveGames
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <steam-id>
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <source-world-id>
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Level.sav  ----------  <- The source world save
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LevelMeta.sav
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Players
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00000...0001.sav
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 12345...6789.sav   <- The source player save
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WorldOption.sav
```

Our SaveGames folder:

```
SaveGames
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <steam-id>
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <destination-world-id>
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Level.sav  ----------  <- The target world save
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LevelMeta.sav
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Players
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00000...0001.sav   <- The target player save
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 98765...4321.sav
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ WorldOption.sav
```

### Transferring from Host to Server (or vice versa)

1. **Create a New Character**  
   - Use the same `Level.sav` file on the world or server after transferring it.
   - Create new character.
2. **Wait for Autosave**  
   - Autosave typically happens within 30 seconds. To be safe, wait at least 1 minute. You can trigger autosave by unlocking Fast Travel or picking up items.
3. **Copy the Files**  
   - Copy the `Level.sav` and `Players` folder to a temporary folder.
4. **Use the Transfer Character Tool**  
   - Load the exact same Level.sav for Source and Target.
   - Select the old character as source.
   - Select the new character as target.
5. **Optional: Keep Old Guild ID**  
   - If you want to keep old bases, tick the option **Keep Old Guild ID After Transfer**.
6. **Start Transfer**  
   - Press **Start Transfer!** You can repeat this for multiple players if needed.
7. **Copy Transferred Files**  
   - Once transferred, copy the `Level.sav` and `Players` folder.
8. **Paste Files into Target Folder**  
   - Paste them into the destination world or server folder.
   - Enjoy your old character!
